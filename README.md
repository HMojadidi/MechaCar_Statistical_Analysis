# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Using statistical analysis with R to analyze automobile performance

# Overview

AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. The data analytics team has been asked to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this project, I will:

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes

* Collect summary statistics on the PSI of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots

* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

* Design a study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers with a summary interpretation of the findings.
